  versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components,
  as well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
  rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries

  any incoming booking request, thanks to the batch (airsched). An
  interactive utility has still to be implemented.
